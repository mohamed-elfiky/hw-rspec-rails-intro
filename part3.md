# Part 3: More controller behaviors

Returning to our original specfile skeleton,
the next spec  says that `search_tmdb` should select the "Search
Results" view for rendering.  Of course, that view doesn't exist yet,
but as in the first example we wrote above, that needn't stop us.

**NOTE:** You could argue that since the default view is determined by
convention over configuration, testing that the "Search Results" view
is selected for rendering is really just testing Rails' built-in
functionality.  But if we were rendering different views depending on
whether the action succeeded or failed, examples like this would
verify that the correct view was selected.

## Verifying that the correct view is selected for rendering

Since Rails' default behavior 
is to attempt to render a view whose name and path match the
controller action, in this case 
`app/views/movies/search_tmdb.html.erb` (or `.html.haml` if you prefer),
our spec just needs to verify that the controller action will indeed try to
render that view template.
To do this we will use the `response` method of RSpec-Rails: once we have
done a `get` or `post` in a controller spec, the object
returned by the `response`
method will contain the app server's response 
to that action, and we can assert an
expectation that the response **would have rendered** a particular
view.  
Like the `post` method used in developing our controller spec,
the `response` method is a facility provided by the `rspec-rails`
gem, not by the core of RSpec itself.

In the code below that you can plug into the correct 
example, the _match condition_ for the expectation is supplied by `render_template()`,
so the assertion is satisfied if the object (in this case the response
from the controller action) attempted to render a particular view.  We
will see the use of `expect` with other match conditions later.
The negative assertion `expect(...) to_not` (or its alias, 
`expect(...).not_to`) can be used to specify that the
match condition should _not_ hold.

```ruby
it 'selects the Search Results template for rendering' do
  fake_results = [double('movie1'), double('movie2')]
  allow(Movie).to receive(:find_in_tmdb).and_return(fake_results)
  post :search_tmdb, {:search_terms => 'hardware'}
  expect(response).to render_template('search_tmdb')
end
```

There are two things to notice here.
First, since each of the two `it` examples
are self-contained and Independent, 
we have to create the test doubles and perform the 
`post` command separately in each.  We will shortly see a way to DRY
out this repetition.
Second, whereas the first example uses `expect`, 
the second example uses `allow`,
which specifies that the test
double method **may** be called but
**doesn't** establish an expectation that that method **must**
be called.  The
double springs into action **if** the method is called, but
it's not an error if the method is never called.

In this simple example, you could argue that we're splitting hairs by
using `expect` in one example and `allow` in another, but the
goal is to illustrate  that _each example should test a
  single behavior._  This second example is _only_ checking that the
correct view is selected for rendering.  It's _not_ checking that
the appropriate model method gets called---that's the job of the first
example.  
In fact, even if `Movie.find_in_tmdb` were
implemented already, we'd still stub it out in these examples,
because examples should isolate the behaviors under test from the behaviors
of other classes with which the subject code collaborates.

## DRY out specs by refactoring common code into a `before` block

Before we write another example, we consider the Refactor step of
Red--Green--Refactor.  Modify your controller spec file to look like this:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe MoviesController do
  describe 'searching TMDb' do
    before :each do
      @fake_results = [double('movie1'), double('movie2')]
    end
    it 'calls the model method that performs TMDb search' do
      expect(Movie).to receive(:find_in_tmdb).with('hardware').
        and_return(@fake_results)
      post :search_tmdb, {:search_terms => 'hardware'}
    end
    it 'selects the Search Results template for rendering' do
      allow(Movie).to receive(:find_in_tmdb).and_return(fake_results)
      post :search_tmdb, {:search_terms => 'hardware'}
      expect(response).to render_template('search_tmdb')
    end
    it 'makes the TMDb search results available to that template'
  end
end
```

As the new  code above implies, there is now a setup block that is
executed before **each** of the examples within the `describe` group,
similar to the `Background` section of a Cucumber feature,
whose steps are performed before each scenario.  
(There is also `before(:all)`, which runs setup code just once for
a whole group of tests; but you risk making your tests dependent on each
other by using it, since it's easy for hard-to-debug dependencies to
creep in that are 
only exposed when tests are run in a different order or when only a
subset of tests are run.)

While the concept of factoring out common setup into a `before` block
is straightforward, we had to make one syntactic change to make it
work, because of the way RSpec is implemented.
Specifically, we had to change `fake_results` into an instance
variable `@fake_results`,
because local variables occurring inside each example aren't visible
outside that example.
In contrast, instance variables of an example group are visible
to all examples in that group.
Since we are setting the value in the `before :each`
block, every test case will see the same initial value of
`@fake_results`.

## Verifying that the controller assigns correct view variables

We started with a list of three descriptions of desired behaviors in
our controller action:


```ruby
  describe 'searching TMDb' do
    it 'calls the model method that performs TMDb search'
    it 'selects the Search Results template for rendering'
    it 'makes the TMDb search results available to that template'
  end
```

There's just one example left to write, to check that the TMDb search
results will be made available to the response view.  

The RSpec `assigns()` method keeps track of what instance variables
were assigned in the controller method.  Hence `assigns(:movies)`
returns whatever value (if any) was assigned to `@movies` by the
controller action, and our spec just has to verify that the controller
action correctly sets up this variable.  

Once again, we will take advantage of doubles.  In our case, we've already
arranged to return our doubles as the result of the faked-out method
call, so the correct behavior for `search_tmdb` would be to set
`@movies` to this value.  Doing so and factoring out the common code
between the second and third specs into their own nested `describe`
gives us this final version of the controller spec.  We chose the
description string "after valid search" to name this nested `describe`
block because the examples in this subgroup all assume that a valid
call to `find_in_tmdb` has occurred; that assumption itself is tested
by the first example.  When example groups are nested, any `before`
blocks associated with the outer nesting are executed prior to those
associated with the inner nesting.  So, for example, considering the
test case in lines 18--20 below, the setup code in lines 5--7 is run
first, followed by the setup code in lines 14--17, and finally the
example itself (lines 18--20).


```ruby
  1 require 'rails_helper'
  2 
  3 describe MoviesController do
  4   describe 'searching TMDb' do
  5     before :each do
  6       @fake_results = [double('movie1'), double('movie2')]
  7     end
  8     it 'calls the model method that performs TMDb search' do
  9       expect(Movie).to receive(:find_in_tmdb).with('hardware').
 10         and_return(@fake_results)
 11       post :search_tmdb, {:search_terms => 'hardware'}
 12     end
 13     describe 'after valid search' do
 14       before :each do
 15         allow(Movie).to receive(:find_in_tmdb).and_return(@fake_results)
 16         post :search_tmdb, {:search_terms => 'hardware'}
 17       end
 18       it 'selects the Search Results template for rendering' do
 19         expect(response).to render_template('search_tmdb')
 20       end
 21       it 'makes the TMDb search results available to that template' do
 22         expect(assigns(:movies)).to eq(@fake_results)
 23       end
 24     end
 25   end
 26 end
```

Strictly speaking, for the purposes of this example the stubbed
`find_in_tmdb`
could have returned any value at all, such as the string "I am a
movie", because the _only_ behavior tested by this example
is whether the correct instance variable is being set up and made
available to the view.  In particular, this example doesn't care what
the value of that variable is.  But since we already had doubles set up, it was
easy enough to use them in this example.

**Summary of this part:**

*  An example of the Refactor step of Red--Green--Refactor is to move common setup 
    code into a `before` block, thus DRYing out your specs.
*  Method stubbing with `allow(...).to receive` creates a 
   "test double" method for use in tests, but unlike  `expect(...).to receive`, 
     doesn't require that the
     method actually be called.
* `assigns()`, an RSpec-Rails extension, allows a controller test to inspect
     the values of instance variables set by a controller action.
